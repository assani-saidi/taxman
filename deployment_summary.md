# Deployment Summary & Next Steps

This document summarizes the process of deploying the Django application to Render and outlines the current status.

### 1. Initial Goal
Deploy the Django application to a live production environment on Render.

### 2. Code Preparation for Production
To prepare the app for a production environment, we:
- Added necessary Python packages for production (`gunicorn`, `whitenoise`, `psycopg2-binary`, `dj-database-url`) to `requirements.txt`.
- Modified `taxman/settings.py` to be production-ready. This included:
  - Reading sensitive values like `SECRET_KEY` from environment variables.
  - Configuring the `DATABASES` setting to connect to a PostgreSQL database via a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
  - Setting up `WhiteNoise` to serve static files correctly.

### 3. Deployment Strategy & Troubleshooting
Our initial deployment strategy using a `render.yaml` blueprint file failed due to a persistent parsing error on Render's side (`unknown type "psql"`).

To overcome this, we switched to a **manual deployment strategy**, which was successful. The steps for this are documented in `deploy.md`.

### 4. Build & Bug Fixes
During the first manual deployment, we encountered and fixed several build-breaking issues:

- **Database Driver Error (`ImproperlyConfigured: Error loading psycopg2`):**
  - **Cause:** A mismatch between the project's specified Python version (`3.11.4`) and the default version used by Render (`3.13`).
  - **Fix:** We set the `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable to `3.11.4` in the Render service settings.

- **Code Syntax Error (`SyntaxError: f-string: unmatched '['`):
  - **Cause:** A line of code in `zimra/helpers.py` had incorrect quote nesting within an f-string.
  - **Fix:** I corrected the line of code to use double quotes for the f-string, resolving the syntax error.

- **Static File Error (`whitenoise.storage.MissingFileError`):
  - **Cause:** The `collectstatic` command was failing because it tried to process `input.css`, a source file with non-standard Tailwind CSS syntax.
  - **Fix:** We updated the **Build Command** on Render to delete `input.css` before running `collectstatic`, ensuring only the final `output.css` is processed.

### 5. Runtime Debugging
After a successful build, the live application was returning `500 Internal Server Error` on most pages.

- **Cause:** Django, in its production configuration (`DEBUG=False`), hides detailed error messages for security.
- **Fix:** We **temporarily enabled debug mode** by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable to `True` on Render. This allowed the specific application errors to be displayed in the browser.

### **Current Status & Next Steps**

- The application is **successfully deployed and running** on Render.
- **Debug mode is currently ON.** This is not safe for a long-term production site but is essential for us to diagnose the remaining issues.
- **Next Session:** Our goal will be to navigate to the pages that show errors, read the error messages displayed by Django, and fix the underlying application code. Once all pages are working correctly, our final step will be to turn debug mode OFF.
