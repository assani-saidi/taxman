# Important
* Check ZIMRA response email
* qrcodes have valid url but saying the invoice is not validated since we have fiscal day errors (assumption), we wait on ZIMRA to reset fiscal day so we see if that fixes the issue
* Create close fiscal day function
* go live with ecocash gateway
* deploy on hostinger vps and configure domain
* Useful links [ZIMRA API](https://fdmsapitest.zimra.co.zw/swagger/index.html) and [ZIMRA API DOC](ZIMRA_DOCS/Fiscal%20Device%20Gateway%20API%20v6.0%20-%20clients.pdf)

## üìç WHERE ARE WE NOW

-- this will be a lot, here is the plan:

* **INVOICE FISCALISATION ERROR LISTS**

  We need to solve RTC error list returned when we submit an invoice.  
  This includes making sure state is `submitted` not `fiscalised`.  
  We must find a way to store these error lists and show them to the user.  
  Also create a **retry function** in each app, allowing users to resend to **Taxman**,  
  which will then resend the same invoice with adjustments.

* **POST FISCALISATION ACTIONS**

  These are actions that must be performed *after* fiscalisation:  
  - Checking certificate validity  
  - Generating QR code  
  - Sending QR code back to the originating app  
  
  Consider creating a **signal** (like a webhook) that sends this response back to the calling app.

- we must do all this for credit notes
- you are left to integrate sage and excel
- also must make sure that resubmitting of invoices when failure and fixing errors if the invoice has been adjusted
